But if a Medical Officer of Health does not believe the risk can be managed by voluntary compliance with directions, they can order temporary isolation/detainment through an urgent public health order, which is enforceable through reasonable force, fines, and imprisonment; this isolation lasts for 72 hours, unless extended by a District Court. Additionally, District Courts can make public health orders that can force contacts to quarantine at home or force patients to isolate either at home or in a hospital. These District Court orders are enforceable with reasonable force, fines, and imprisonment. The Medical Officer of Health qualifies as the national government, as they are designated by the Director General.
