**Overview**

Analysis and Mapping of Policies for Emerging Infectious Diseases (AMP EID) is a first of its kind tool to inform the future of pandemic preparedness policy and outbreak response. AMP EID enables rapid identification of the global policy environment to facilitate response efforts. This tool creates a single site to examine which countries are parties to international agreements relevant to pandemic preparedness and response, what laws and regulations are in place to govern EIDs, and other relevant factors that will impact a nationâ€™s response to public health emergencies.

Our research team has identified relevant international agreements and national laws and regulations, curated these documents from around the world, created metadata to help understand and search for key policy components important in a response effort, and provided easy access to original text for further explorations.

In addition to aiding in rapid response efforts, these data contribute to ongoing research activities to assess what policies work under different types of governance structures, and for what types of diseases. We can begin to understand how the success of response policy is influenced both by the characteristics of national governance and legal frameworks as well as by the characteristics of the event itself. AMP EID will enable decision makers in jurisdictions around the world to rapidly understand the policy, legal, and regulatory environment they must operate in to mitigate the impacts of an emerging public health event.

AMP EID is a platform that will continue to evolve. It currently identifies which international agreements a country is a party to, as well as implementing legislation for key treaties and agreements. It includes data on national regulations and laws, such as vaccination requirements, export control and data sharing rules, and intellectual property rights legislation. It curates data from around the world and will continue to expand over time. Please reach out to us at globalhealthsecurity@georgetown.edu with questions, concerns or recommendations.

_Access and Benefits Sharing_: Data last updated March 1, 2024

The goal of access and benefit-sharing (ABS) in global health governance is to ensure that countries that provide access to genetic resources, including pathogens, receive equitable access to the benefits derived from their use. The increasing digitalisation of health data has brought this issue to the forefront of discussions on global health security and health equity. While originally conceptualised in supranational agreements, implementation of these treaties requires national-level legislation in each country.

_Antimicrobial resistance and water, sanitation, and hygiene_: Data last updated August 1, 2023

Unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) contributes to a high burden of disease and exacerbates factors that promote the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Enforceable policies are foundational to curbing inappropriate use of antimicrobials and providing safe WASH. While many countries have established National Action Plans for AMR that include provisions for WASH, few have codified these plans into legally enforceable policy. Here, we provide a comprehensive map and describe the current regulatory environment for WASH.

_Childhood Vaccination and General Vaccination Policy_: Data last updated March 1, 2024

Vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) present a resurgent threat to global health security and jeopardize decades of advancements in public health and economic development. Since 1974, childhood vaccinations are estimated to have prevented 154 million deaths from VPD, yet recent declines in routine vaccination rates highlight the global population's growing vulnerability to these diseases. When paired with appropriate access to healthcare and trusted information, evidence informed enforceable policies have demonstrably improved childhood vaccination rates in countries that have recently implemented more stringent laws on routine vaccination. Here we comprehensively map and describe the current legal environment for childhood vaccination.

_Military Engagement_: Data last updated March 1, 2024

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, militaries around the world mobilized at an unprecedented scale to support domestic response efforts. This was consistent with the growing trend of asset mobilization for military operations other than war during public health emergencies. However, the global scale and vast breadth of civil-military cooperation during the pandemic invites new considerations regarding the authority and scope of domestic operations of militaries during public health emergencies. We have systematically analyzed domestic military deployment policies in each UN member state, focusing on the authority, execution and scope of military involvement pertaining to domestic public health emergencies.

_Quarantine and Isolation_: Data last updated March 1, 2024

Countries across the world implemented diverse quarantine and isolation policies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with varying levels of efficacy. Their widespread use invites new considerations regarding the effectiveness of domestic quarantine and isolation policies, the ways they are enforced, and the jurisdictions responsible for ordering these measures.

_Trade and Intellectual Property_: Data last updated February 28, 2023

Given the challenges associated with negotiating the COVID-19 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Waiver, there are questions as to whether the World Trade Organization is able to effectively address pandemics and global crises under the current architecture. Although the framework set out by the TRIPS Agreement does not view intellectual property (IP) rights as a means to foster public health and development, IP rights should nonetheless be interpreted through a public health lens. Countries should implement compulsory licensing provisions into their patent legislation, which increase access to medicines and allow governments (especially in developing and least-developed countries) to better protect public health.
